Explanation about building the inventory website.

Through the building of an inventory website you can understand that you can build an inventory website for selling about any merchandise. This will provide an option as you leverage in the future.

Through the building of an inventory website you will learn constructing classification, category, attributes for merchandises. By adding merchandises to your inventory web store you will learn how an inventory web store operates. You will also learn how to operate Perl and some syntax and features of Perl. Plus you will learn or enhance your knowledge about html and javascript.
I will let you have direct experience with Perl, html and javascript.

You can imagine that you are building a full functional inventory web store. You can add multiple classifications, categories and attributes. You can work on the pictures to be uploaded to your inventory webstore (for example, using gif transparent pictures). I will let you have the capability of formatting the front part of the home page. If possible I will let you have the capability of reformulating adjustable parts of your inventory web store.

Your inventory webstore will be compared with the website of other groups of your classmate, on functionality, integrity, features, esthetics such as symmetry, proportion, color and hue.
